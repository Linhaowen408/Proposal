# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I think it might be the "Snake game".

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project is to start with a small snake that is one block long, and keep eating and growing as long as it doesn't hit the edge.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project "Snake Game" will be run in Python. It is playable and it is the same as the snake games we usually play.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I'm not sure what the course is called, but it's about making mobile apps, and like Python, it requires code to complete.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I plan to complete this project by myself.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will get the project done no matter what, even if itâ€™s not perfect or great.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can finish making this project and record the video and submit it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to complete all the homework for the final project and demo.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I also need to master other python skills and need to research some topics related to games.
